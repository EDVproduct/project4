IMPORTANT REQUIEREMENTS FOR THE GAME

- Player can not move off screen
- Vehicles cross the screen
- Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
- Vehicle-player collision resets the game
- Something happens when player wins


The player figure can be moved by the arrowkeys left right up and down within a little playfield.
The enemy figures are little bugs moving in the playfield from left to right and the playfigure has to avoid touching them and try to cross to the other side.
On the other side points will be counted hearts will be added and level will added.

- Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
