#frogger arcade game 

Is an practise of my Udacity nanodegree 
Without any gamer experience I tried the best I can following as best as I can the projectspecification.


The game functions correctly and runs error free

- Player can not move off screen
- Vehicles cross the screen
- Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
- Vehicle-player collision resets the game
- Something happens when player wins


The player figure can be moved by the arrowkeys left right up and down within a little playfield.
The enemy figures are little bugs moving in the playfield from left to right and the playfigure has to avoid touching them and try to cross to the other side.
On the other side points will be counted hearts will be added and level will added.

- Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.
